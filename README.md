The purpose of this project simply to demonstrate how to use design patterns in your implementation. Usually developers are lazy to read books or explanation in tutorial, however they are so interested in when reading code and comments, so I'm trying to collect what I knew from books, tutorials and put everything together in code with as much as clear explanation. 

- Each design pattern will be structured in one java package
- In each design pattern package, I divided into 2 packages: one is not-good-best-practice which demonstrate common code that we usually implement, one is best-practice which demonstrate how much code is clear and better when we applied appropriate design pattern. Hopefully this can help developers to understand clearly why we should use design pattern in particular cases.
- Of courses, with limited knowledge the mistakes might happen in this project, so if you think you can make to project is better, please feel free to contribute your idea/code, this is highly appreciated.
